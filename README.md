## Instructions

The memory card game, also known as concentration, is a card game in which a selection of cards are laid face down and two cards are then turned over for each turn.  The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.  If matching pairs are found they remain shown, if not the cards get turned back over - thus a game of remembering where certain cards are.
In this version the game is rated on the time and moves taken to find all pairs.
